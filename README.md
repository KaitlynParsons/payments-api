# Payments API
Coding test of a basic payments API.

# Setup
- npm install
- To Build: npm run build
- To Run: npm run start
- To Run Test: npm run test

# Notes
- payments-api.postman_collection.json can be imported to postman for further manual testing.

## Considerations
- Improved and fleshed out schema validation
- Timezones
- Improved error handling (meaningful errors, cleaner/reusable implementation)
- Updating future payments to a different date
