# Payments API
Coding test of a basic payments API.

- TODO: business days logic, scheduled payments tests

# Setup
- npm install
- To Build: npm run build
- To Run: npm run start

## Considerations Given I Spend More Time
- Improved and fleshed out schema validation against full request body etc
- Timezones
- Improved error handling
